  <h2><p>ACCEPTING FREEDOM ; Walking out - from under the shadow of the curse.		  Today’s  culture is an incredible mishmash of conflicting ideas and philosophies. In this high tech – get anything you want now ; i.e., order it today and get it tomorrow society ; few are willing to really investigate a matter in depth. A prime example would be in the political world. In America , Canada  or virtually any other country; you have two or three parties , who behind closed doors are buddy- buddy  ; working out policies , programs ,deals and  “ wink the eye understandings  “ designed to empower  , protect and enrich themselves at the expense of the people they are suppose  to represent. That is bad enough, but unfortunately it is also how the vast majority of “faith based” religious organizations operate.   One must never “rock the boat” lest they get thrown overboard and are feed to the sharks. This is how todays “enlightened” world works. Sounds more like the   Medieval   days of   the inquisition. Is it actually 2018   or   did CERN blow another fuse   and send us back to 1492 ?    Yeah… you better “tow the line” or face the totalitarian consequences.   So … here I am  , throwing massive iron chains over my shoulders , stepping into cement slippers and heading to the depths of the marianas trench . Why ? ; because I have the audacity to ask you to think.  Yes…actually … think.
Yeshua ; the one much of the English world calls  Jesus ; Y’shua - did  not come to “save the world” ! Or did He  ? Maybe – maybe not.
    I have fond memories of my youngest daughter – Sarah. Well over twenty years ago now  , of how she would tell her mother and I something then, add the tag line , “maybe…maybe not “. We raised her and her brother to be honest and to not intentionally   tell a lie. She has always had a very tender heart   , and especially so during  this time in life and just to “be sure” she would add this tag line . It could have become irritating, but for the fact that she was deadly serious. Not wanting to do wrong; not even by mistake.</p></h2>
<h2><p>  It is time we all get  off  of our “blessed assurance” , grab a copy of the scriptures –read it from beginning to end; yes; Genesis thru Revelation; and  ask the Ruach/ spirit of GOD to reveal truth to us-directly. The word of GOD tells us that “if you seek me  , you will find me”.  A deeper study of this passage reveals it to actually mean- if you continually seek revelation of GOD and his word ,(scripture;Truth:Yeshua), that He will continually reveal Himself  and give deeper understanding of  His word, to us.
 He desires personal two way communication with His children.
  We are all guilty of assuming we know what a passage means as soon as we read or hear it. We naturally accept   the surface understanding of a matter. For instance   ; as I just shared the little story of   our youngest daughter and son   ; you most likely assumed that we had   a  boy and two  girls. Maybe…maybe       not. You see, we had the privilege of raising a beautiful little girl and  a   wonderful  little boy.  He had a sister and she had a brother ; and that was all they personally experienced. But , that was not the whole story. We lost our first little child…KELLY ; thru a miscarriage . Due to the early stage of development , the doctors could not determine if  Kelly was  male or female. The following year we lost our second child …ARIEL , a little girl.
 The western mind set ; the way most of us think or process information, is the result of twelve to twenty years or more of government indoctrination known as public “education”. No longer are people taught how to actually think but rather we have scientific theories and philosophical   interpretations crammed down our throat’s . Both of which the “experts” regularly   alter   “the facts”, in order to support their view of the world.  That is bad enough, but unfortunately   this very attitude   permeates   the  arena of believers  in  GOD.</p></h2>
<h2><p>The qodesh/holy scriptures were given by the almighty , into and thru an eastern / agriculturally based  society. About as different from today’s world as one could get. You see, the western mind set thinks in terms of yes or no ; black or white ; up or down , A or B. The Hebrew mind set is more along the lines of ; YES ,  both , black  and  white and not A or B , but A thru Z…or Aleph thru Tav.
Words on a page do not convey the full understanding the  author  is attempting  to express. WE must continually dig deeper to expose more gems of truth.
	               For the last 1900 plus years the religious world in general and the Judeo/Christian world in particular , has developed  a western concept of explaining everything  by assimilating the facts  ; that is , the “facts” that they want to accept , and then put them in a concrete  sarcophagus  and thinking – “there’ we have figured it out… now don’t screw around with it”.     Intellectuals   , political  pundits  and religious leaders have used this tactic to amaze , befuddle and confuse the masses for ; well , forever – to maintain control. They have been very successful. As we venture out into the 21st century the world has never before had access to such an enormous amount of scientific   and  spiritual / religious knowledge. Yet many would argue  that we  as a whole have become so dumbed down ,we no longer understand truth; most do not care to investigate it.  What  is  truth ?  Psalms 119:142 & 151 , tells us …Your righteousness is righteousness forever and Your Torah is Truth.(142). You are near O Yahovah , and all Your commands are truth (151).
