<h1><em>Introduction</em></h1>

  <h2><p>This site will atempt to provoke thought and understanding of theological concepts that are often short sighted and/or even purposely misleading; in order that a particular <em>"pet idea,</em>" is emphasized.
  </p></h2>
<h2><p>
  No doubt, trolls out there will rise up to dispute anything put forward. That's ok. I not only accept in full God's Torah; His instructions; of which all scripture is - Torah - Instructions.  "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction , for instruction in righteousness": II Timothy 3:16 KJV.
  Unfortunatly the Torah ignorant are universally guilty of misinterpretation of the "WORD",in that "... some things [are] hard to be undertood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest [twist], as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction,"II Peter 3:16.
  It is vitally important to note that both of these, 2Tim. 3:16 and 2Pet. 3:16, are directly referring to, what at that time, was known and accepted as Holy writ; namely, the TORAH - the inspired word of the Almighty dictated and spoken to Moses/Moshe.  One small portion was directly written by the <em>Very Hand of God</em>.
</p></h2>
<h2><p>
  The Tanak - made up of the five books of Moshe, the prophets and the wisdom writtings of Psalms, Proverbs, etc. When Peter, Paul and their contemporaries were giving instructions to followers of <em>"The Way,"</em>these letters were highly regarded but, it is doubtful any believers at that time, as yet, regarded them to be scripture. So when admonished to follow the "WORD" -<em>His Scripture</em>- everthing had to pass through the lense of accepted Holy scripture - Torah and Tanak.
It would be well over 100 years after the assention of Y'shua/Jesus the Messiah that the body of believers as a whole, would affirm the apostalic letters as being inspired scripture, along side the Tanak. I too accept this, for our Father's scripture is Echad; it is <em>ONE</em>. Sixty-six books united as one - Echad. </p></h2>
<h2><p>
  So, the trolls out there who would rather divide than unite; go ahead and make your own website, post your own undertanding and " work out your own salvation with fear and trembling..." Philippians 2:12. We all learn through self study.  I think we are all sick and tired of the self righteous bickering and drama on the internet and YouTube. Everyone trying to prove how spiritual and smart they are! Again, we all need to follow the Master's example.  State what we believe without attacking individuals.  After all, with study and insight, we continue to gain deeper understanding and closer fellowship through and with "the WORD" and "It's/His Intent."
