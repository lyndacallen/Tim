    <h2> 51 , we read…”There is one Torah for the native-born and for the stranger who sojourns among you”. And all the children of Yisra’el did as Yahovah commanded Moshe and Aaron , so they did And it came to be on that same day that Yahovah
      brought the children of Yisra’el out of the land of Mitsrayim according to their divisions.(tribes). Verse 48 of exodus 12 states that all in the camp of the Hebrews , both natural born and those who choose to join in and become a part of
      Yisra’el… that they all ,”shall perform Pesah”(Passover). Note; the word “shall” is a legal term which means you “will” or must do” , as opposed to you should or may do, which gives an option of doing it. Herein is no option . If we are of His
      Kingdom we “shall “– will do it. The Apostle Paul; Paul being the Greek name ,(meaning – “worker”), and Saul his Hebrew name ; Paul reaffirms Exodus 12:3 when he states that you ,the believers in Yeshua are no longer Greek or Gentile or people
      of the nations –pagan ,male or female …but are one in Messiah ha’Mashiah. Now according to Psalms 119, Genesis 1:1 and John 1:1-5, Y’shua (Jesus) is the Torah ! Thus what Torah says is what Y’shua says and what Yeshua says is what Torah says.
      The harsh reality is that if you reject Torah you are rejecting Y’shua. The book of Numbers tells us “they” ,the grafted in believers , were to be welcomed in as brothers/sisters – as if they had the actual blood of Ya’acob (Jacob).The big
      caveat though was they/we, were/are to fully accept and follow the same rules – ways to worship YAH as the 12 tribes; aka., To follow Torah.

    <h2>These formerly Pagan Gentiles – which is what the word Gentile means – Pagan or originally ,” people of the nations” ; means, they (we) are no longer of the nations or pagan but are adopted into Yisra’el. They were and we are assimilated
      into one of the 12 tribes . We may not know which of the 12 tribes we are a part of until we enter into the Millennial Kingdom but we will know in time , when it is necessary . Ezra 2:59 relates how this has already occurred in the past. “and
      these were those who came up from Tel Melah …but they were unable to show their father’s house , and their seed , weather they were of Yisra’el . Though these individuals could not serve as levitical priests, they were accepted in/ adopted in
      as children of Yisra’el according to Numbers 15:15-16. Remember , the Holy – Heavenly city of GOD ; the new Yerusalem has 12 gates ; one for each of the twelve tribes of Yisra’el. There is no “Gentile” gate. If you “ ain’t “ in one of the
      twelve tribes ----you in a whole lot “o” trouble ! Moving forward ; King Solomon/Shelomoh ;though most people know he was once called the wisest man in the world , this did not translate into good character or obedience . He was in fact in
      many ways a wicked King ; doing nearly everything he could to directly disobey Torah. This so angered Elohim that He vowed to split the kingdom of greater Yisra’el in two.
  </p>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <h2> When King Solomon died , Yahovah arranged for one of Solomon’s high officials to go north and he formed the Northern Kingdom of Yisra’el ; also referred to as Ephraim or Yoseph ; with 10 of the tribes. In the south, where the Temple was ,
      the descendants of King David continued to rule what was known as Yahudah or in German – Judah, pronounced with a “Y” sound , but in English, perverted and pronounced with a “Jay” sound. Biblical Hebrew has never had a “Jay” sound in it. David
      and Yeshua are part of the tribe of Yahudah –the “jews”. This southern kingdom also contained the tribes of Benjamin and part of Levi ; and a handful of all the tribes who left their land inheritance, staying faithful , to worship at the
      Temple . Thus the two houses of Greater Yisra’el were formed ---Yisra’el / Ephraim/or Yoseph in the north and Yahudah in the south. Both countries did wickedly and upset the Father. YAH , Himself , calls His chosen people a “stiff necked
      people”. This is still evident today being clearly shown, in that most of the House of Yahudah accept the written Torah but reject the walking Torah – Y’shua as messiah and most of those who identify as being Christian , accept Y;shua as
      messiah/savior , but refuse to do His commands –Torah. The whole House of Yisra’el , a stiff necked people indeed !
  </p>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <h2>In 721/722 B.C. , YAH used Assyria , the birthplace of Hamas and ISIS; …to punish and conquer the northern 10 tribes –forcing them into exile and eventually assimilating them into all the world ; later becoming known as the” 10 Lost Tribes
      of Yisra’el “ .The punishment prescribed by Yahovah for the house of Yisra’el / Ephraim was that they were to be banished from their GOD given land of Erietz - Yisra’el for a period of 390 years. If after this time, they , as a whole ,
      repented of their sins and returned to the land ; they would be fully restored and greatly blessed of YAH . Unfortunately they never repented as a whole and few made their way back. Some scholars estimate that between 2400 – 3000 total from
      the 10 northern tribes immigrated to Yahudah/Judah so as to be faithful to follow Torah and worship at the Temple as long as it stood. This was in defiance of the northern kingdom’s kings who would not permit their subjects to live in Ephriam/
      Israel; the 10 northern break away tribes; and go south to worship at the Holy Temple. And , certainly they never were returned to their former land inheritance . Instead they were scattered to the ends of the earth ; losing their land , their
      culture and their original identity. See ; Ezekiel 4:5 & Leviticus 26: 14-28 . GOD is faithful and true to His own word. His prescribed punishment must be carried out . The Father stated that if Ephraim did not repent , then their “seed” – the
      following generations would have to wait 390 years times 7 or 2730 years , before, He would lift the curse and the penalty be paid in full. Deut.28:64 ; Ezek. 4:5 ; Leviticus 26:28 . “And if you walk contrary to me , and refuse to obey me , I
      shall bring on you seven times more plagues , according to your sins. Leviticus . 26:21 .</h2>
  </p>
  <h2>
    <p> Because of their attitude toward GOD in general and His Torah in particular , He - Yahovah (YHVH) actually divorced the northern house of Yisra’el (ephraim) . See Jerimiah 3:8 ; “ and I saw that for all the causes for which backsliding
      Yisra’el had committed adultery , I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce… The Southern Kingdom , the house of Yahudah was driven out of the land in 586 B.C. by Babylon . They repented and were allowed back in by decree of
      King Cyrus , 70 years later . There is no scripture ; that I am aware of ; that the almighty ever divorced the house of Yahudah - the 2 ½ tribes that makeup what has become known collectively as the “JEWs “. Again… why did GOD divorce Ephraim
      ? Read Deut. 28 verses 58-59 ,45 ,and 64-66 in this order … “ If you do not guard to do all the Words of this Torah that are written in this book , to revere this esteemed and awesome Name , YHVH (Yahovah) your Elohim , then YHVH shall bring
      upon you and your descendants extraordinary plagues , great and lasting plagues and grievous and lasting sicknesses .And all these curses shall come upon you , and they shall pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed , because you did
      not obey the voice of YHVH your Elohim , to guard His commands and His Laws which He commanded you. And YHVH (Yahovah) shall scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other , and there you shall serve other mighty ones
      (false gods ) , which neither you nor your fathers have known, wood and stone. And among those nations you are to find no rest , nor have a resting place for the sole of your foot. But there YHVH shall give you a trembling heart , and failing
      eyes , and sorrow of being. And your life shall be hanging in the suspense before you , and you shall fear day and night , and not be certain of your life. [This is not referring to Yahudim / Jews for though they adopted many Takanot; man made
      rules in place of YAH’s Torah ; they still adhered to the idea of one {ECHAD} GOD , not stone idols. He goes on to say…Lo-Ammi …you are no longer my people , and I am not for you. Hoshe 1:9 . “My people have perished for lack of knowledge.
      Because you have rejected knowledge , I reject you …since you have forgotten the Torah of your Elohim , I also forget your children. Hoshe 4:6. I have known Ephraim and Yisra’el has not been hidden from Me. For now , O Ephraim , you have
      whored , Yisra’el is defiled . Their deeds to turn back to their Elohim , for the spirit of whoring is among them and they do not know YHVH. Hoshe 5:3-4 . Put the ram’s horn to your mouth , like an eagle against the House of YHVH , because
      they have transgressed My Covenant and they have rebelled against My Torah. They cry out to me ,” My Elohim – we , Yisra’el , know You” ! Yisra’el has rejected what is good(Torah) , an enemy pursues him. Hosea 8:1-3. And ; they refused to
      listen , and they shrugged their shoulders , and stopped their ears from hearing …they made their hearts like flint against hearing the Torah-(GOD’s instructions ; the WORD ; the Aleph-Tav ; the Messiah ; Y’SHUA/Jesus) … the words , which YHVH
      of hosts had sent by His Ruach/Spirit thru the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from Yahovah of hosts. “And it came to be : as He called and they did not hear , so let them call , but I shall not hear ,” said YHVH of hosts. Zekaryah
      7:11-13. { THUS } They (we) shall not dwell in the land of YHVH/ Yahovah , but Ephraim shall return to Egypt (metaphorical for the world system), and eat uncleanness… ( eating things the almighty says are detestable to Him)Hoshe 9:3… Isaiah
      66:17. Y’shua says ; “ Do not think that I came to destroy ( put away with ) the Torah or the teachings of the prophets’ , I did not come to destroy but to complete ; to live out as an example . Whoever , then , breaks one of the least of
      these commands , and teaches men so , shall be called least in the reign of the shamayim / heaven ; but whoever does and teaches them, shall be called great in the reign of the shamayim / heaven . Matt.5:17 & 19 .</p>
  </h2>
  <h2>
    <p>Y’SHUA/JESUS , promised to return and renew all things. “ ‘Come and let us turn back to YHVH , For He has torn but He heals us , He has stricken but He binds us up. After two days {2 millennia} He shall revive us. He shall raise us up , so
      that we live before Him. Hoshe 6:1-2. So , rejoice –“and let not the son of the foreigner who has joined himself to Yahovah speak , saying , Yahovah has certainly separated me from His people’ “Also the sons of the foreigner who join
      themselves to YHVH , to serve Him and to love the name of YHVH , to be His servants , all who guard the Shabbat/the seventh day rest , and not profane it , and hold fast to My Covenant . The Adon (LORD) Yahovah , who gathers the outcasts of
      Yisra’el , declares , “I still gather to Him besides those who are gathered to Him . Isaiah 56:6 & 8. And have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created him . Colossians 3:10.</p>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <h2> Our knowledge of Him / His Word will be renewed. He – Y’shua was and is the walking , talking , TORAH , the very GOD – YAHOVAH in the flesh ! This is what the religious leaders of His day crucified Him for. You see they had no problem
      accepting a political savior or military or even religious savior ; as long as he can be controlled- manipulated to follow man’s rules ; i.e. , to be politically correct “. “ How dare He tell me/us how to live , just because He created
      everything and is the rightful owner of everything . ----Who does He think He is ? GOD ! ? . The Almighty says what He means and means what He says. We make mistakes all the time. Some of those “mistakes” are considered to be sin , even if we
      may not realize it . We do not have to be doing or acting in what we would normally consider to be evil or wicked to actually be in error. This is why the scriptures clearly teach and endorse grace and forgiveness of sin. However, we are
      warned not to trample GOD’s grace under foot ; ignoring His clear instructions. In times past the vast majority of us were simply ignorant of scripture ; partly thru the ignorance of our so called shepherds/pastors ; partly thru our own
      indifference and laziness but mostly because as a whole we were actually under the punishment of a divinely instituted curse. A curse , so as we - people of faith in Yahovah / Yeshua , would see / understand much , if not most of His word “as
      thru a glass darkly “ or as “having a veil over our eyes “. Only an extremely miniscule number of individuals thru the last 2000 years were blessed with the understanding that all of the Scriptures are meant for all of GOD’s children , all of
      the time . “And now , if you diligently obey My voice , and shall guard My Covenant , then you shall be my treasured possession above all the peoples - for all the earth is Mine – ‘and you shall be to Me a reign of kohenim/priests and a
      qodesh/holy nation… Exodus 19 : 5-6 .” and has made us kings and priests to His Elohim and Father…Revelation 1:6 . But , this promise has always been to “ he who overcomes and guards My works until the end , to him I shall give authority over
      the nations “ Revelation 2:26 .The end is revealed in the beginning . “ All the congregation of Yisra’el are to perform it , and when a stranger ( non-blood born Hebrew ) shall sojourn with you and shall perform the Pesah / Passover to YHVH ,
      let all his males be circumcised , and let him come near and perform it and he shall be as a native of the land . But, let no uncircumcised eat of it . There is one Torah for the native – born and for the stranger who sojourns among you .
      Exodus 12 : 47-49.

    <h2>On the very day Yahovah; thru Moses/ Moshe ; lead the captives out of Egypt , (the world system ), all the people present were considered to be part of the commonwealth of Greater Yisra’el ; if ; in faith they accepted and actually followed
      GOD’s requirements , His instructions on how to love Him and their neighbor - commonly called the Torah. This , may seem to be a strange idea , doctrine. Indeed , it took me nearly forty years in my faith walk to grasp these truths. Even the
      great mind of the brilliant , apostle Paul/Saul took three years of intensive thought and study ; at the foot of Mt. Sini ; to sort out the truth ; apart, from false religious traditions and deeply held beliefs based on dogma and not Torah.
      Did you realize that about 83% of the scripture is ignored or marginalized by the modern “Christian church” ? This 83% is what the Bereans were studying to verify if what Paul taught actually harmonize with YHVH’s instructions . This 83% was
      the only universally accepted “ Word of GOD” recognized as authoritative by all stripes of followers of Y’shua - for over 300 years after the resurrection. The last 17% ; the Apostolic writings ; added into acceptance, was ; is simply
      commentary on the previous 83%. When Y’shua sent out His disciples on their first teaching , evangelical mission ; He ordered them to preach “ the good news of the Kingdom “. They had no Apostolic Gospels or epistles to teach on or with . Also
      , they had no concept of their messiah dying or being raised up from death . They simply expounded upon the Torah… to live it because the living Torah had arrived and He was about to reunite the Kingdom ; a united Kingdom of Greater Yisra’el ;
      and make all things right . There is not now , nor ever were there two different peoples of GOD ; Yisra’el and “the church’. They are one in the same . Moses/ Moshe speaks of the “church” ; actually the assembly – in the wilderness .
  </p>
  </h2>
  <h2>
    <p>The modern – gentile/pagan derived word – church , has its origins in Latin and is extracted from the root word for a circus. How appropriate ; it is quite descriptive of the modern , powerless , social clubs of most western societies known
      as the “church” . The false teaching of the Father having 2 different peoples ; commonly referred to as the “church”/Christians and also the “Jews/Israel is simply that… a false man made idea. The ALMIGHTY is NOT a schophrenic polygamist . He
      is one GOD – ECHAD in Hebrew ; meaning a unity of one ; though he chooses to reveal Himself at times as the Father or the SON or thru His displayed acts via the RUACH haQodesh / Holy Spirit. The word “church” , was not used in translations of
      the scriptures until King James demanded it be used in the 1611 KJV ; instead of the actual known meaning -assembly ; as was correctly shown in the Geneva Bible version used by the Pilgrims. They – the Pilgrims , despised certian cleaverly
      manipulated portions of the KJV. By the way ; Y’shua / Jesus never had a brother named “James” , either . This too was swapped out in place of the correct name - Ya’acob . You see Ol’ King Willie , was quite the anti-semite as was most of the
      Gentile church from about 150 A.D. onward ; when the Nicolaiten dogma invaded and took over control ; setting up an ecclesiastical hierarchy ; A.K.A. – professional churchmen. The Apostle John himself was given the “left foot of fellowship”
      i.e. kicked out of a local fellowship/”church” by an anti-semite preacher , 3 John 2:9 . This preacher ; Diotrephes , is an early example of the pagan greek mindset attempting to force his ideas of Christianity onto a local assembly instead of
      simply following the ancient path (Jerimiah 6:16)-“ the way” as it was reffered to for millennia . In the Apostlic writtings of the Gospels thru Revelation , Y”shua emphatically states ; 20 times ; to “follow me “ , not your own ideas , your
      pastor or your “church fathers”. If you insist on being separate from Yisra’el and it’s Hebraic lineage then you are in danger of being - “without Messiah ; excluded from the covenants of promise ; having no expectation and without Elohim in
      the world” . Ephesians 2:12 . Y’shua Himself said ; “ I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Yisra’el” . Matt.15:24. But, the great news is that - you , once gentiles who were called the uncircumcision can draw near in
      obedience ; not only thru circumcision of the flesh ; as an outward sign , but also circumcision of the heart ; submitting in obedience to His will , His Torah , for daily living . He is our peace , who has made both one and having broken down
      the partition of the barrier ; ( the curse / punishment of sin ) . Eph.2:11 & 14. So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners , but fellow citizens with the Qodeshim / Saints and members of all the household of Elohim . Eph. 2:19 . So ;
      what is expected of those who wish to be part of Yahovah’s special - set apart – chosen people ? It really is quite simple ; read the scriptures from beginning to end ; Genesis thru Revelation ; asking the Ruah / Holy Spirit of GOD to guide
      and instruct . He is faithful and just . Basic steps are to first admit – openly - out loud to the Father that you / I – all of us have sinned against Him and our fellow man . Then do as He instructs us . Begin by avoiding sin . What is sin ?
      It is not what man or some religious institution says ; sin is what GOD’s word says it is . “Everyone doing sin also dose lawlessness , and sin is lawlessness” ; {with out Torah } 1John3:4. “Everyone staying in Him , dose not sin . 1 John 3:6
      . If we mess up and sin ; we repent ; turn around 180 degrees ; asking Y’shua for forgiveness , and follow the admonition He gave so often to others : “Go and sin no more” . His children walk in faith and obedience . Remember , the demons
      “believe” in Y’shua/Jesus ; but they definitely do not follow His example in living by His instructions – Torah . They do not “Shema” ; hear and obey , His word . Deut. 6:4-6 Please … don’t get all bent out of shape trying to figure it all out
      at once . Many of the instructions of Torah do not even apply to you or me . I am not a woman ; so the specific guide lines given for women in GOD’s word do not apply to me. I am not a Levite Priest and there is no Temple ; so these related
      instructions simply can not be practiced . /p>
  </h2>
  <h2>
    <p>The primary impetus or driving focus of the Torah was and is to bring us life and life ever more so abundantly . As we honor our Heavenly Father thru faithfulness in following His word-Y’shua ; He blesses us with a great joy - a joy
      unspeakable . Those who criticize Torah - GOD’s instructions on how He says to love Him , usually , do not accept or practice it. These are “those who are untaught ignorant and unstable tossed about by every wind and wave of doctrine who-
      twist it ,(it’s meaning), to their own destruction , as they do also the other scriptures …being led away with the delusion of the lawless “. 2nd Peter 3:16…17 . By this we know that we love the children of Elohim , when we love Yahovah and
      guard His commands , for this is the love for Yahovah that we guard His commands , and His commands are not heavy. 1 John5:2-3. But instead let us … Grow in the favor and knowlage of our Adon/ Lord and Saviour , Y’SHUA ha’Mashiah/ Messiah . To
      Him be the esteem / glory , both now and forever . Ameen . 2nd Peter 3:18. How do we start ? 1) Accept that all of the scripture is valid for all of GOD’s family. 2) Read all of the word , not just little feel good snippets . 3) Do the Fathers
      will – His commands -His instructions of love… do them ; one at a time. 4) Begin with the ten (10) commandments. Do not forget or minimize the longest of all these …the forth command ; seventh day of rest. The only command the Father Himself
      states is a sign of “ His” children … the only sign. In the bible version I most often use, this , 4th command is detailed by 104 words ; by far the longest of all the commands . Now some brothers my point to Matthew 22:37 – 39 …and Y’shua
      said to him “ you shall love YHVH/ Yahovah your Elohim with all your heart and with all your being , and with all your mind.’ This is the greatest command. “And the second is like it, “You shall love your neighbor as youself .’ TRUE. Yes
      Ameen. But, read on the very next verse. “ On these two Commandments hang ALL the TORAH , and the Nebi’im ”/ Prophets. To fully do the book end Commandments we must do the interior. An Oreo cookie without the icing inside just “ain’t an Oreo
      cookie.! Oh taste and see the LORD is good. Psalms 34:8. Further King David states…The Torah of YHVH/ Yahovah is perfect , bringing back the being, (converting the soul), The witness of YHVH is trustworthy , making wise the simple ; The orders
      of YHVH are straight , rejoicing the heart ; The Command of YHVH is clear , enlightening the eyes ; The reverence of YHVH is clean , standing forever ; The right - rulings of YHVH are true . They are righteous altogether , More desirable than
      gold ; Than much fine gold ; And Sweeter than honey and the honeycomb . Also , Your servant is warned by them , In guarding them there is Great Reward. Palms 19: 7-11. We are most privileged to be in the world at this exact period of time ;
      the biblical time of Jubilee when old debts are forgiven and the people / family of the Most High are being restored to the family and kingdom of Yahovah . Accepting freedom. It is a very interesting fact that often men who have been in
      prision for 30 or 40 years , then are granted freedom by the courts , often refuse to leave. They have been incarcerated so long that they no longer know how to think for themselves nor are able to take on the personal responsibility of
      providing for themselves. They become willing slaves. PLEASE , do not be counted as a willing slave to the deception fostered by ignorant or cunning false prophets and wolves in sheeps clothing. </p>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <h2> The curse is lifted we are free to walk into the glorious light of His freedom. He who the son sets free is free indeed. Finally , please hear my heart. I in no way think of myself as being in any way more “saved” than anyone else . In fact
      the more I understand of how Y’shua pointed us to show our love for Him thru obedience to Him / Torah ; I realize how far short I fall. I have no doubt whatsoever many believers who go by the title “Christian” but do not yet try to follow
      Torah; may well have a greater reward and position of responsibility in the age to come than I. Yet, these same individuals could have had a far greater reward if they had more closely followed Y’shua’s example. I urge all to step out of the
      shadow of “feigned” obedience . Accept your freedom – come out from among them… false believers / organizations ; “seeker friendly “ groups who would strive to please man and grow in numbers rather than to obey and please the Heavenly Father
      and grow in grace.
