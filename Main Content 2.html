    <h2><p>Until relatively recently  this   phenomenon  has been perplexing to many ; of how intelligent people will accept  things without question ; especially  in the Judeo/Christian  community. As believers / followers of the Almighty, we have HIS own  personally written and declared word – the qodesh/holy scriptures .  Along with the written word of  YHVH / Yahovah ,the Aleph-Tav ;[aleph is the first Hebrew letter and Tav the 22nd /last letter of the Hebrew alef/bet…alpalebet].  He has also provided understanding thru the impartation of His  Ruach/Holy Spirit.								At this point ,  I ask you,  to ask the Ruach/Spirit of  YAH  to open your understanding  of how scriptural truths are being revealed to many thousands of seekers around the world. 							 I would like to make known that I am in no way some spiritual intellect. Though I did obtain a B.A. degree in Bible/Missions about 35 years ago from a denominational college , I never pastored a congregation  nor did any full time missions work. In fact for 30 plus years , I/we were content to help out as Sunday school teachers ,altar work , local food pantry  , choir ,usher  and other related activities associated with a local body of believers.  The last few years has actually revealed to me how that “religious  training” i.e. – indoctrination ,a.k.a. – programing , may have hindered  my ability to grasp the very truths  of the kingdom I was longing for.										We have had a massive  paradigm  shift in our realization that GOD’s word is actually true !  ; Ps. 119:142 & 151. He means what He says and says what He means. “I am  GOD , I change not” ! Ps. 89:34                   						Some basic concepts to entertain in order to “see” my understanding would be … (1)  YESHUA /Jesus   did not come to earth 2000 years ago to “save the world”.  WHOO , Stop right there , Wait a minute. Are you…am I crazy ? or some kind of religious fruit cake ? “Maybe  –  Maybe not”. </p></h2>
      		<h2><p>		First  , I do believe the door of salvation is open to all the world. Every human ever conceived on this planet has had or will have the opportunity to “know”   GOD   and experience eternity with Him ; if they/we  qualify ;  according to  His word.								What dose His word say ? YESHUA said …I came NOT, but for the lost sheep of Yisra’el.   Matt.10:6 & Mark 15:24.
He also went on to proclaim …” it is not fitting for the children’s bread to be feed to the dogs”  ; that’s most of  -  us… the people known as Gentiles. In my case and I sincerely hope in your’s ,  we can now say …formerly Gentile but now- Hebrew, by choice   , by adoption. If you accept Y’SHUA and follow His guidelines for life   , you are grafted into His family.			Who are GOD’s people   ?  Elohim – the Hebrew word for GOD   ; Elohim, chose to display His mercy and justice to the world thru a people   called   Ibri  ,  ibrim ; where we get todays version  called Hebrew(s). The original meaning of the  word  - Hebrews – in context , simply means the crossed over ones , or separated ones.								Abram/Abraham crossed  over  the  Euphrates   river to begin his walk of obedience  to Elohim.  This   obedience   to   Elohim’s instructions was an act of following Torah.									Torah is much more than just law   , as   the western mind typically understands it.  It includes  , but is not limited to, only , the first five books of scripture  dictated  and even in part actually written by the very hand of the Almighty. Torah also includes any instructions of our Heavenly Father –Abba. Scores of times it is written in the scriptures that His word will last   FOREVER   and  His plans   WILL NOT FAIL .	Ps.33:11			After more time in communion with Elohim and living in the light of   His   instructions / Torah    ; Elohim promised to bless Abram with a special  son , a – “son of promise” – Issac. This was when Abram’s name was changed to Abraham, meaning the father of many.	Many   years later Abrahams  descendants  grew  to  a  band of  70 Hebrews who moved into northern Egypt, called Mitsrayim in Hebrew ; and grew to be a nation of 2 to 6 million ; divided into twelve (12) distinct tribes.			      The man – Mitsrayim , whom Egypt was named  after was the uncle of Nimrod. Nimrod ; the first secular world ruler , the first  attempt of man to take the place of the Almighty.</p></h2> 					  <h2><p>After coming out of Mitsrayim and back into Eretz - Yisrael  ;  the holy land of Yisra’el  ; the Hebrew people dishonored  Elohim / Yahovah , by insisting on having an earthly king to rule over them- just like the non-torah observant , pagan/gentile nations.							The word gentile has always been equated as pagan.					Though the prophet and last judge – Samuel , warned against it , he anointed Saul as their first earthly king and also David to rule after Saul.  King Saul was often rash , wanting to rule his way and not  patiently   follow  Yahovah’s  instructions , His Torah , “the way” .   Many believers today do not realize that the scriptures clearly require a King of Yisra’el to personally – with his own hand – physically sit down and write a personal copy of the Torah as delivered by Moshe. Thus,  there  would never be an excuse of ,”not knowing” , GOD’s will – GOD’s law.  When  kings did not do the will of the Father; they, were without excuse.  Psalms 19:7-8. If an installed  king did not personally copy his own scroll of  the Torah , he was not a truly legitimate king and thus could not receive all of  the promised blessings  of obedience. Neither  he  nor  his  subjects .						       						Let me pause here  and  encourage  anyone -  who truly wishes to live by and diligently follow,  the master Yahovah , or, as is stated 45 times in  the  original  Hebrew  scripture – YAH . First,   please do not let yourself be overwhelmed  . New believers  who had no upbringing in the ways of GOD,  in both the book of Exodus  ,Leviticus ,Numbers , Deuteronomy as well as Galatians ,Romans  and Corinthians ;  we  are  all instructed  to simply cease  practicing  gross obvious ,abominations – sin [see 1john 3:4 & psalms 119:142’151] ; then to regularly meet with and learn from those who are more  knowledgeable  in the scriptures.  A key  precept  to always apply is to ask the spirit of YAH ; the RUACH ha Qodesh , to guide you in understanding of his word.  Test  teachings   using scripture to verify scripture. A  safe , proven way to start is to apply and practice “the 10 words”  ;  a Hebrew idiom  for  the 10 commandments; which the Father Himself personally wrote with His own hand.													Exactly seven weeks after the first exodus from Egypt ,  the new nation of Hebrews known as Yisra’el , were encamped at the base of Mt. Sini .Coinciding with the exact date later to become known as Shavuot / Pentecost.  This is where  Yahovah , Himself ,  came down to the top of the mountain with fire , smoke , and lightning. He spoke directly to the millions of newly freed people. They were so scared they actually begged   YAH   not to talk to them directly  but, instead to go thru Moshe.  Again   ,  proving most people refuse to be personally responsible for their relationship with the Almighty. It was here   , at  Mt. Sini that Yahovah gave Moshe a contract. In fact it was a marriage contract,  called , the Ten Words – the 10 commandments.	Moshe , Aaron and 70 elders of the 12 tribes  had a marriage banquet. [exodus 23:7-12] After  presenting  the Father’s  proposal   to the masses , they  corporately  said , “I do”. [exodus 23:7] This is the basic outline of  YAH’s  instructions for properly following Him and respecting the people we live with , our Hebrew family  and Goyim / Pagan Gentiles , at times called the Nations.	The Father then goes on from the basic “10 words” in Exodus  chapter 20  to fill in the details or fullness of His word - His contract  ;  in Exodus chapters 21 thru 23.You see, GOD did not want anyone messing around with His Word – His marriage contract. So , He included ; in the full expanded explanation  of the contract ; all of the books from Genesis thru Deuteronomy as subsections to make clear the stipulations of said agreement. Just  like  a  good  lawyer  ; He  leaves  nothing  to  chance .	</p></h2> 										<h2><p>	Deuteronomy 4:2 states…”Do not add to the word which I command you and do not take away from it , so as to guard the commands of  Yahovah your Elohim which I am  commanding  you.			As time went on , most of  the individuals in the 12 tribes of Ya’acob;[ ancent  Hebrew had  no “J” sound in it] continually failed to follow the conditions of the marriage contract. So much so , that by the time of King  Solomon (Shlomo),- David’s son and just the third  and last King of a unified Yisra'el’, that , the people… following the King’s bad example, openly began to incorporate pagan worship practices into and alongside of   that ordained by Elohim/Yahovah .  A   direct  , in the  face  of   GOD  , violation of Deut. 4:2;12:32 & chapter 13. Also , these  three scriptures are the very same , used to test a prophet , preacher ,  priest or teacher to determine if they are scripturally true or false.  							Scripture clearly tells us not to “see” how foreign – pagan/gentile people worship their  “gods” and incorporate those ideas ,ways and holidays into Yahovah’s  prescribed way of worshiping Him. Deut. 12:2-4 & Lev. 18:1-5. Yet , they did and the modern “church” dose the exact same thing.												When Moshe  lead the Hebrews out of Mitsrayim and  into the wilderness many , many  people not of the blood of Ya’acob also joined them ; Egyptians , Greeks , Europeans , Africans and other  Semitic  groups of men and women, who , had also been slaves. They too “  got  out while the  getting  was good “.  Indeed   , Genesis 12:38 calls them “ a mixed multitude” .  Yet   , though they came out of many cultures ; once they voluntarily joined themselves to the Hebrews, they  were adopted  or grafted into the nation of Yisra’el – with all the rights  , privileges  and responsibilities  of every native - blood born Hebrew.  					In Exodus 12:49
